# Automated Script to install CTF Tools, Wordlists and Scripts :wrench:

Personal recopilation of tools, wordlists and scripts.

### Tools :bomb:
* [Dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)
* [NmapAutomator](https://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomator)

## ToDo List :notebook:
- [ ] Add more stuff
- [ ] Add more stuff
- [ ] Add more stuff

### It's my first bash script, so don't take it into account.
### I have done it because I had nothing better to do.
### Any contribution to improve it will be appreciated. :heart:
